## Baseline Models of Lyman-Alpha Emission at the End of Reionization (z ≈ 5–6)

With JWST, it is now possible to use Lyman-Alpha (Ly α) emission from galaxies beyond z > 8 to trace neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) as the Universe became reionized. However, observed Ly α emission is scattered by neutral hydrogen in the IGM and in the interstellar and circum-galactic medium, necessitating baseline models of Ly α properties in an ionized IGM to disentangle these effects.

In this work, we characterize Ly α properties at the end of reionization (z ≈ 5–6), providing a baseline that can be applied to z > 6 observations.

## Observations

Field: GOODS-N
Instrument: MMT/Binospec
Spectral resolution: R ≈ 4360 (rest-frame UV)
Sample: 236 galaxies at z ≈ 5–6 (selected from HST/CANDELS)
Ly α detections: 62
We additionally use JWST observations from JADES and FRESCO for a subset of our sources to characterize Ly α properties as a function of UV continuum and H α emission.


## Key Results

- First statistical measurements of the Ly α FWHM distribution at z ≈ 5–6.

- Developed empirical baseline models of:

- Ly α equivalent width (EW<sub>Lyα</sub>)

- Ly α escape fraction (f<sub>Lyα,esc</sub>)

- Conditional on UV magnitude and slope.

## Main Findings

- EW<sub>Lyα</sub> and f<sub>Lyα,esc</sub> depend on UV magnitude.

- For galaxies with M<sub>UV</sub> = −19.5: 5 ± 5 % have EW<sub>Lyα</sub> > 25 Å <62 ± 8 % have f<sub>Lyα,esc</sub> > 0.2

- Mean Ly α FWHM: 245 km/s

- Median Ly α velocity offset: 258 km/s

= Both correlate with higher UV luminosity.

## Interpretation

Our median observed Ly α line profile is broader and shows a higher velocity offset compared to pre-JWST models based on z ≈ 2 lines. This may reflect:

Resonant scattering by residual neutral hydrogen in the IGM at z ≈ 5–6, and

Increasing ISM/CGM densities at these redshifts.

The resulting median Ly α profile predicts higher transmission in a fully neutral IGM, offering insights into recent z > 10 Ly α detections.
