Description of files and folders in DDD-SlitLosses

Folders:

- Seeing : Here is a code to measure the seeing of different exposures, this is done through the physical width
            of the calibration star in the different masks. I advice doing this for the individual exposures of each mask.
            Doing it to the final science product will not be as accurate. 

- Files

- LyaSurfaceBrightness.py : Different functions used by main.ipynb
- main.ipynb : Here is an example on how to run the slit SlitLosses
- SlitsObj.py : Slit Object that we work on in main.ipynb, all functions are commented
