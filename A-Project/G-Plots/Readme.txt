Here I will describe the folders and files on the E-Plots folder.
The main goal of this folder is to produce figures for the paper.

Folders:

    - infall : Figures from the infall given many sightlines
    - profiles : Old plots of Lyman alpha profiles
- For Paper : Lya and optical lines shown in the paper
- Lya-Ha-Document : Contains all files needed to produce a .tex document withe very source, its Lya/Ha profile and a 2D cutout with FRESCO pointing
- MakeFigures : Here I produce all the figures for the paper. This will read the main catalog and get data from there
